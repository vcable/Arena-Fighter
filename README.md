**What is Arena Fighter?**
Arena fighter is a simple text-based game where the player is pitted against various enemies.
The player can choose between three classes: Fighter, Hunter, and Mage.  
As of right now, the game is in very early stages, but as time goes on I plan on adding more complex features like
XP, more advanced AI, more encounters, more classes, and more abilities/spells/items/weapons.
