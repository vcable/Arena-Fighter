**What is Arena Fighter?**
Arena fighter is a simple text-based game where the player is pitted against various enemies.
The player can choose between three classes: Fighter, Hunter, and Mage.  
As of right now, the game is in very early stages, but as time goes on I plan on adding more complex features like
XP, more advanced AI, more encounters, more classes, and more abilities/spells/items/weapons.

**Changelog**

**Version 0.2** -- 3rd update, 10/19/19

This update adds all five encounters to the game.  I might add more later, but for now I think that five is plenty.  
The current enemies are, in order:

    Weak Swordsman
    Bear
    Seasoned Gladiator
    Basilisk
    Small Dragon

Each enemy has a unique weapon.


**Version 0.11** -- 2nd update, 10/19/19

This update adds functionality to allow mages to cast spells.  At the moment, there are only 3 spells: Fireball, Ice Arrow, and Meteor Shower.  
The player is able to select which spell they would like to cast before attacking each turn.


**Version 0.1** -- Initial release, 10/19/19

*Classes*

The game currently has 3 classes: Fighter, Mage, and Hunter.  The Fighter class is fully functional, but the Mage class
is missing some spell casting abilities, and the Hunter class has not been tested but should work in theory.

*Gameplay Loop*

The game only has one encounter at the moment, with a Weak Swordsman named Glorb.  Glorb has the ability to attack, but that's about it.
In future updates I'll give enemies the ability to drink health potions when they are low on health, and switch weapons/spells.

*Items/Weapons*

There are only 4 weapons right now, with each one being the default for either a player-selectable class or the enemy.

*Styling* 

The styling is non-existent at the moment.  I'm definitely going to add colored text, formatting, and the like when I get the core game fleshed out.
