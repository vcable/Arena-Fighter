**What is Arena Fighter?**

Arena fighter is a simple text-based game where the player is pitted against various enemies.
The player can choose between three classes: Fighter, Hunter, and Mage.  
As of right now, the game is in very early stages, but as time goes on I plan on adding more complex features like
XP, more advanced AI, more encounters, more classes, and more abilities/spells/items/weapons.

**How to Run the Game**

If you're interested in checking out Arena Fighter, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies listed below, and run *main.py* with Python 3.  
DISCLAIMER: THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED AT ALL
